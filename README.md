Simple module to convert data table (CSV/SAS7BDAT/JSON) into NDI format released under the MIT license.

## About ##
The formatting and validation convert supported data files into acceptable NDI datasets for submission. The validation is not intended to support an arbitrary NDI file, but one which has been generated by the included formatter.

### Disclaimer ### 
No guarantee of any kind is made that this code produces the desired output. Please inspect your own data to ensure that it is correct, and contribute to improve the current formatter/validator.
